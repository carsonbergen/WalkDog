# How to install and start up
## How to get the project on your machine

- or use the gh cli to clone the repo.

## How to setup the project
Once you have the project on your machine, install the node modules:
```bash
npm i
```

## How to run the program
```bash
npm run dev

This will give you a link to open in your browser. If it does not for whatever reason then try `http://localhost:5173/`.

There is also a deployed version of the application at `https://walk-dog.vercel.app/`.

## How to use the app
Jazmin is the recommended user to log into, as this is the only account that is not a shell user.

On the empty route (`http://localhost:5173/` or `https://walk-dog.vercel.app/`) click the `Log in!` button.

From there, enter in:
- `jazmin@gmail.com` in the `What is your account's email?` field.
- `guest123` in the `What is your account's password?` field.

Then click `Log in!`.
