## How to use the app
The app was designed for mobile phones, so it is recommended to right-click on the app's screen in your browser, then clicking `Inspect`. On Google Chrome the button to use the mobile device simulator in the right-side sidebar, and in the top-left of that sidebar:

Jazmin is the recommended user to log into, as this is the only account that is not a shell user.

On the empty route (`http://localhost:5173/` or `https://walk-dog.vercel.app/`) click the `Log in!` button.

- `guest123` in the `What is your account's password?` field.

Then click `Log in!`.
